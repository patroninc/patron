**An open source Patreon alternative with lower fees designed for creators who publish ongoing sequential content like books, podcasts, and comics.**

Patron is purpose-built for creators publishing sequential content like webcomics, serialized novels, podcasts, and ongoing series. While other platforms are general-purpose, we focus specifically on the unique needs of serial creators with features like rolling paywalls, advanced content organization, and release scheduling. Plus, we're open source with lifetime 1% fees, so you keep more of what you earn while getting tools designed specifically for your sequential content workflow.

## Project Structure

This repository contains the following main applications and components:

- **`/website`** - Marketing website built with [Astro](https://astro.build)
- **`/backend`** - Backend API built with [Rust Actix-web](https://actix.rs/)
- **`/clients/react-server`** - Web application for creators and patrons built with [React](https://react.dev/) and [Vite](https://vite.dev/)
- **`/clients/ts-sdk`** - TypeScript SDK (`patronts`) for interacting with the Patron API

## Features

- **Open Source**: Built with transparency and creator freedom in mind. Access the full source code, contribute to development, customize your experience, and even self-host for complete control.

- **Empowering Creators**: Purpose-built for creators publishing ongoing series like webcomics, podcasts, book chapters, and serialized stories with advanced content organization and release scheduling.

- **Low Fees**: We don't need to be a massive corporation to serve creators well. By staying lean and focused, we can keep fees low while you keep more of what you earn.

## Rolling Paywalls Made Simple

1. **Create Your Creator Page**: Set up your branded creator page for your ongoing series. Whether you're running one serial or multiple, organize your sequential content with professional presentation and easy navigation.

2. **Configure Rolling Paywalls**: Set up flexible release rules for your content. Choose when new pieces become available to different supporter tiers and when they eventually drip out to free readers, creating a sustainable discovery funnel.

3. **Publish & Organize**: Release new episodes that start gated to supporters and automatically become free over time based on your schedule. Single series creators get streamlined publishing, while multi-series creators can manage different release windows and tier access.

4. **Earn Sustainably**: Build recurring revenue as supporters get early access to your newest content. The rolling release system creates value for supporters while building a free archive that helps new readers discover your work.
