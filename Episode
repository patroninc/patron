🔥 Episode 1 — “The First Night”

The rain started at the exact moment the taxi stopped in front of House No. 77.
The house looked like an animal curled up under the storm—
old, silent, and unnaturally still.

Navarin stepped out of the taxi.
The printed rental contract in his hand was already wet,
but his eyes were fixed on the upstairs window—
the one that had just closed.

Even though he hadn’t entered the house yet.

When he opened the door, the smell of damp soil and burnt paper drifted out.
He dropped his suitcase.
Raised his phone to light the hallway.
And that was when the first strange thing happened.

On the entrance wall, written in faint, uneven letters, was:

“Welcome home, Navarin.”

He whispered to himself,
“I… haven’t even introduced myself…”

Then came the breathing.
Slow.
Deep.
From upstairs.

Navarin exhaled sharply.
Maybe he was hallucinating. Maybe just tired.

But when he turned on the light downstairs,
there was a notebook on the table—his own notebook—
the one he was certain had been inside his bag.

It was open to a page he didn’t remember writing.
A single sentence stared back at him:

“The first night, I only watched you.”
