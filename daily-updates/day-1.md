**Getting your company website right - Day 1 Building patron . com**

One of the lessons I learned from my YC startup is that "startups" are more similar to traditional businesses than anyone gives them credit for. Everything is top of funnel and the easiest top of funnel to get is what Google will give you for free. You're shooting yourself in the foot by not taking advantage.

SEO consultants and backlinks are a great value right now. Supply is higher than demand for these services so things are cheaper than they should be and it's a great way to leverage spend. Especially if you have a good idea that targets a niche with high intent keywords. 

Patron is a great example. I am laser focused on creators who post serial content that has a 1, 2, 3. ... order to it. I'll be damned if I'm not ranking for the relevant keywords within a month of launching the site. I'm putting a ton of time and effort into building this thing and I want the people who I'm building it for to know about it.

Why you should care out of the way, I want to share what I think is the optimal way to go about building the site. Like anything worth doing, getting traffic is hard and you need to put in effort to do it. The lowest hanging fruit to making that happen is to build out a custom site and pay attention to detail. 

I am against no-code site builders like webflow and others because they limit you long term. MDX is powerful because you can do things that make your content feel higher qualty. Think embed React apps inside of your mdx blogs, tweak small details like structure in your RSS feed, or go above and beyond with interactive page elements.

I cannot recommend Astro enough. Astro simplifies making sure you have an accurate sitemap, no layout shift from images, images compressed into the right format (avif), structured content not in your code, and a RSS feed for your blog. It's just the right solution for the job full-stop. You're making life hard by using anything else. 

Last, but most important, separate your content from your HTML. You as the founder do not have time to waste optimizing the damn website. SEO consultants who can research search intent and optimize things for you are very affordable and smart to hire. Set them up for success by using a CMS. I recommend using Keystatic with Astro. 

Final tip, you should have a waitlist up before you launch. If you want something free and self-hostable, I recommend listmonk. It's worked great for me and is a joy to use.
