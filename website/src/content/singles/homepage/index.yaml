    - title: Create Your Creator Page
      description: >-
        Set up your branded creator page for your ongoing series. Whether you're
        running one serial or multiple, organize your sequential
        content with professional presentation and easy navigation.
    - title: Configure Rolling Paywalls
      description: >-
        Set up flexible release rules for your content. Choose when new pieces
        become available to different supporter tiers and when they eventually
        drip out to free readers, creating a sustainable discovery funnel.
    - title: Publish & Organize
      description: >-
        Release new episodes that start gated to supporters and automatically
        become free over time based on your schedule. Single series creators
        get streamlined publishing, while multi-series creators can manage
        different release windows and tier access.
    - title: Earn Sustainably
      description: >-
        Build recurring revenue as supporters get early access to your newest
        content. The rolling release system creates value for supporters while
        building a free archive that helps new readers discover your work.

  title: Frequently Asked Questions
  items:
    - question: Who is building this and why?
      answer: Hi, name is Nick. I go by <a class="underline" href="https://x.com/skeptrune">skeptrune</a> on RoyalRoad and other platforms. I have been using Patreon for over a decade, primarily for serialized content, and I think it should be better. It's used for serialized content but doesn't support it well. Using the like button as a bookmark is frustrating. Not having a way to download content for a roadtrip or flight is annoying. The platform doesn't support its new and successful creators with marketing opportunities and fun live events, which is disappointing. I think I use it enough to really understand how it works and how to build a better version. It's going to be the same, just with a lot more care about getting it right.
    - question: How are you going to keep fees low?
      answer: We are going to be ruthless about keeping the infrastructure simple and cheap so our operating costs remain low. Those savings will be passed on to creators in the form of lower fees. I don't have plans to make things complicated, it's a relatively simple platform, and we just aren't going to charge as much as Patreon does on top of Stripe. We're not raising venture capital or anything that would put pressure on us to increase fees or maximize profits. The goal is to keep things sustainable, affordable, and creator-friendly for the long term.
    - question: How does Patron compare to Patreon?
      answer: Patron is purpose-built for creators publishing sequential content like webcomics, serialized novels, podcasts, and ongoing series. While Patreon is a general-purpose platform, we focus specifically on the unique needs of serial creators with features like rolling paywalls, advanced content organization, and release scheduling. Plus, we're open source with lifetime 1% fees for early users instead of 8-12%, so you keep more of what you earn while getting tools designed specifically for your sequential content workflow.
    - question: Are you going to have a discord integration, emails, and community chat?
      answer: Yes, absolutely. We will be at feature parity with Patreon and aren't cutting any existing functionality. You'll have Discord integration, email systems, community chat, and all the core features you expect. We're just expanding the feature set specifically for serial content creators, not removing anything that already works well.
    - question: What happens to my existing Patreon supporters if I switch?
      answer: Nothing! Just post in both places at once and direct your new subs to Patron so you get to keep more of their support. Eventually, once most people have swapped over, maybe consider shutting down your old Patreon.
