    <p>Hi there,</p>

    <p>
      Welcome to the Patron waitlist newsletter! I'm Nick, though I go by
      <strong>skeptrune</strong> on RoyalRoad and most other social platforms.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm a software engineer and entrepreneur. I previously built a company
      called Trieve, where I went through the startup accelerator Y Combinator,
      raised $3.5M in venture capital, and sold it for a multi-million dollar
      outcome 2.5 years after starting in January 2023.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now I'm launching a more personal business venture with Patron. As an avid
      Patreon user who primarily follows webnovel serials, I've never been
      satisfied with the experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      Patreon primarily serves creators with serial content like comics,
      stories, video game extensions, podcasts, content with ordered episodes
      like 1, 2, 3, etc. It allows you to set up membership tiers that provide
      access to a certain number of preview posts ahead of the free platform
      where you distribute.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, that's where their support for this workflow ends. There are no
      automatic "next" and "previous" buttons, no bookmarking to track which
      post or episode you finished last. I want to build exactly that kind of
      functionality for myself as a user first and foremost!
    </p>

    <p>
      For creators, I want to build something higher quality while charging
      <strong>significantly</strong> less. I'm targeting 3% fees long-term
      instead of Patreon's current 10%.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's going to be an exciting journey, and I can't wait to share more with
      you! Expect updates multiple times a week.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cheers,<br />
      Nick K<br />
      Chief Entrepreneur at Patron
